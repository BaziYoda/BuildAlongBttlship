Battle-ships Game
involving Html, Css and Java-Script
This showed me a lot on JS where I was the most inexperienced at the time of the project. 
It was helpful in getting used to calling functions, writing classLists and gave me more time and practice writing for-loops.
This is not an all emcompassing Js project by any means, But a foundation in which to evolve my understanding and knowledge of it. ( I am still a work in progress lol, as we all our ;)

Thanks to Kubowania, CodeStacker and Web Dev Simplified for providing this build along.
